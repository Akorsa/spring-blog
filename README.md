spring-hibernate
==========================

This project demonstrates configuration and various uses of Spring Data JPA with Hibernate. Blog posts covering various aspects of the application can be found at http://nixmash.com.

The app uses MySQL backend. Since this is for purpose of demonstration, configure connection in AppConfig class. Use setup.sql in /install to create schema and populate tables.

The app is based on Chapter #7 of Pro Spring, Fourth Edition from Apress, "Using Hibernate." (An excellent book, btw.) Here is [the book's listing on Apress](http://goo.gl/q2w50H). For fellow Safari users, here is the online version of it [on Safari](http://goo.gl/TD6nuO).
