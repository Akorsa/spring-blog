##Installation##

The application supports an H2 Profile (default) and a MySQL Profile. To run JPA Console app use **$gradle jpa:bootRun.** To run
MVC Web app use **$gradle mvc:bootRun.** The Tomcat Server Port is set for **8084** (set in the MVC _application.properties_ file)
so go to **http://localhost:8084** to view the app in your browser.

##Database Configuration##

To use MySQL run _setup.mysql_ script in the /doc/install directory to populate the database. Update Datasource connection
properties in _/resources/META-INF/spring/mysql.properties_ file. The H2 create-data script for the tests is located in
_/resources/db._

##References##

 **Version 0.0.1** of the app was based on Chapter #7 of Pro Spring, Fourth Edition from Apress, "Using Hibernate."
 (An excellent book, btw.) Here is [the book's listing on Apress](http://goo.gl/q2w50H). For Safari users, here is the
 online version of it [on Safari](http://goo.gl/TD6nuO).

 The Generic DAO structure in **Version 0.0.3** was based on Chapter #2 of Spring in Practice by Willie Wheeler and
 Joshua White, "Data persistence, ORM, and transactions." Here is the [Chapter on Safari](http://goo.gl/Q9uoTl).

 Multiple database JPA Configuration implemented in **Version 0.0.8** based largely on the work of Gordon Dickens' [Spring-Data-
 Demos "Profiles" project](https://goo.gl/IuaWoR).

 Several components related to Thymeleaf and Security in **Version 0.1.x** from Arnaldo Piccnelli's [Enhanced Pet Clinic.]
 (https://github.com/arnaldop/enhanced-pet-clinic)

 Petri Kainulainenâ€™s excellent book [Spring Data](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/spring-data) from Packt
 Publishing and accompanying source code was a reference for Model Attribute handling and feedback messaging in **Version 0.1.5**
 as well as other features.

 Two excellent source references for Spring Security which initially appeared in **Version 0.1.6** were Rob Winch's [gs-spring-
 security-3.2](https://github.com/rwinch/gs-spring-security-3.2) something and Bartosz Kielczewski's [example-spring-boot-security]
 (https://github.com/bkielczewski/example-spring-boot-security).
