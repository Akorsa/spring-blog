##Installation##

+The application supports an H2 Profile (default) and a MySQL Profile. To run JPA Console app use **$gradle jpa:bootRun.** To run
MVC Web app use **$gradle mvc:bootRun.** The Tomcat Server Port is set for **8084** (set in the MVC _application.properties_ file)
so go to **http://localhost:8084** to view the app in your browser.

##Database Configuration##

To use MySQL run _setup.mysql_ script in the /doc/install directory to populate the database. Update Datasource connection
properties in _/resources/META-INF/spring/mysql.properties_ file. The H2 create-data script for the tests is located in
_/resources/db._

##References##

 **Version 0.0.1** of the app was based on Chapter #7 of Pro Spring, Fourth Edition from Apress, "Using Hibernate."
 (An excellent book, btw.) Here is [the book's listing on Apress](http://goo.gl/q2w50H). For Safari users, here is the
 online version of it [on Safari](http://goo.gl/TD6nuO).

 The Generic DAO structure in **Version 0.0.3** was based on Chapter #2 of Spring in Practice by Willie Wheeler and
 Joshua White, "Data persistence, ORM, and transactions." Here is the [Chapter on Safari](http://goo.gl/Q9uoTl).

 Multiple database JPA Configuration implemented in **Version 0.0.8** based largely on the work of Gordon Dickens' [Spring-Data-
 Demos "Profiles" project](https://goo.gl/IuaWoR).
